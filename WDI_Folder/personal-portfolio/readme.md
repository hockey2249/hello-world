**Objective:** The goal of this project is to build an Angular application with your own back-end. Your app does not need to have user authentication, but it must be a CRUD app for a single resource.

## Requirements

What you build is up to you, but you must follow these requirements:

* Your Angular app must have at least TWO client-side routes (use either `ngRoute` or `ui-router`) with associated templates and controllers.
* Your Angular app must send at least TWO HTTP requests (use either `$http` or `ng-resource`) to your server.
* You must build your own API with Javascript to handle these requests

* Your app should be beautifully designed and pleasant to use. Write user stories, draw wireframes, and use well-designed websites as inspiration.
* Your code should be organized and commented, and you should push your project to GitHub with frequent, descriptive commit messages.
* You should not write any jQuery or [Vanilla Javascript](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20435653/what-is-vanillajs) DOM manipulation. Try your best to do angular-style DOM manipulation using built-in and custom directives.

## App Ideas

* <a href="http://josephrocca.com/startupideasgenerator" target="_blank">Startup Ideas Generator</a>
* A Stack Overflow clone with questions, answers, comments, and votes.
* A microblog, journal, or to do list.
* A "Yelp for" - create reviews about anything - yoga studios, online stores, toast, you name it.
* A flashcard app for studying, with decks of flash cards.
* Anything else you can think of!

## Example Stretch Features

* Create and use a <a href="https://github.com/den-wdi-1/intro-angular-lab/blob/master/custom-directives.md" target="_blank">custom angular directive</a>.
* Use an <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io" target="_blank">angular-ui module</a> for a UI component or feature.
* Incorporate an external Angular directive *other than an angular-ui module* (for example, `ngDraggable` or `ngStorage` - one place to browse is <a href="http://ngmodules.org" target="_blank">ng-modules</a>).

## Getting Started

1. Create a repo on Github to contain your project.
1. Create an appropriate `.gitignore`.
1. Create a `readme` explaining the purpose of your project, in addition to any other relevant information.
1. Plan out your user-stories and simple wireframes.
2. Plan out how you will present this next week, and get any resources together that you will use for this presentation.
1. Happy coding (don't forget to commit frequently)!
